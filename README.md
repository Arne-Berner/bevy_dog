# Difference of Gaussians
Difference of Gaussians is a versatile tool in creative coding. It can be used for edge detection, thresholding and some other effects. 
Please take a look at [this paper](https://users.cs.northwestern.edu/~sco590/winnemoeller-cag2012.pdf) for how it works in detail. [This Video by Acerola](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5EuYKEvugLU) combined with their [provided code](https://github.com/GarrettGunnell/Post-Processing/tree/main/Assets/Edge%20Detection) inspired me to try and bring this to bevy.
