# How does it work?
Blurring?
Texture?
masking? (I think it was either + or *)
multi sampling? https://webgpufundamentals.org/webgpu/lessons/webgpu-multisampling.html

# gauss:
## 4 images
taking the gaus of the image 4 times with different thresholds: easy -> just apply it in one shader 4 times and combine them then
## rotation
same for rotation. I could add the option for every rotation in there, so that I would be able to change them from outside
## texture
